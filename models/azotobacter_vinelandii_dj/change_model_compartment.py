"""
Fixes iDTR1278.xml model compartment naming.

For some reason, the model compartment is labeled as '_u' for all species.
Within the model, the BIGG ids add _* to each ID, ie, atp_p for periplasm.
So with the _u error, there would be atp_p_u, which throws off comparisons.
Fixing this plus exporting model, then will do a comparison between the
models to see what the differences are.
